I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Dr. Whendee Silverâ€™s lab](https://nature.berkeley.edu/silverlab/) at University of California, Berkeley. I am an ecosystem ecologist by training with broad interests in carbon and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. I received my Ph.D. degree from University of California, Santa Barbara, working with [Dr. Jennifer King](http://geog.ucsb.edu/~jyking). Here is a sample of questions that I am interested in:

How does redox fluctuation affect the stock and stability of soil organic matter?

How does sunlight influence biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystem?

How do human disturbances influence terrestrial biogeochemistry?

I use inter-disciplinary approaches to answer these questions. I establish manipulative experiments in the field and in the laboratory. My field sites spans a wide range of ecosystems, including arid grassland, sub-tropical forests, and agricultural landscapes. I take a variety of analytical approaches to characterize the physical, chemical, and biological properties of plant, soil, and water samples.
