This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
Installation of Jekyll on my Windows PC was tricky, but doable thanks to 
[Jens Willmer's tips]( http://jwillmer.de/blog/tutorial/how-to-install-jekyll-and-pages-gem-on-windows-10-x46)

The template was forked from a [starter kit] (https://jabranham.com/blog/2016/01/making-academic-website.html). 
Thank you, Alexander!
