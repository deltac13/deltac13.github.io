* As a teacher and scientist, I have two overarching goals in teaching and mentoring students: first, to assist and engage students in learning the concepts, processes, and models essential to the discipline of environmental science, and two, to cultivate their skills in analyzing, solving, and communicating issues central to their lives, whether in environmental science or not. I have over six years of experience in teaching discussion and laboratory sections at the university level. My teaching interests are broad, and I could readily teach courses such as introductory Soil Science, Biogeochemistry, Biostatistics, and Earth System Science.

* My teaching employs a wide range of techniques, depending on the specific goals at hand. I expose my students to a wide variety of teaching material, such as maps, videos, and government reports. I utilize active learning techniques to improve studentsâ€™ problem-solving and communication skills. Problem-based exercises are commonly used in my teaching to illustrate how knowledge learned from lectures can be used to solve real-world issues. 

* I evaluate student performance using multiple approaches, because learning styles often differ widely among students. I believe in frequent assessment of student progress, because it helps them to succeed and also provides me with an opportunity to adjust my teaching to meet their learning needs. I also believe in acquiring periodic feedback from students on my teaching using anonymous questionnaire and one-on-one conversations during the office hours.

* Outreach is an essential part of my academic career. I am committed to conducting an outreach program that connects my research to the needs of local residents and land managers. I routinely contribute to K-12 education via guest lecturing, mentoring student research, and science fair demonstrations.
